readme.txt for max radio project
November 3, 2011

version: maxsdr5c

This program is available in 3 forms:

1) all files - maxsdr5 folder
2) max/msp collective - maxsdr5_collective folder
3) standalone app - maxsdr5_app folder

These instructions apply to all versions:

1) unzip the the file you downloaded. It will be a folder.
2) when you run max/msp add the folder to the user filepath in options : file preferences
3) Check online documentation for help on how to use the program http://zerokidz/radio

4) If you hear periodic buzzing (comb filtering) when using the FUNcube, increase the signal vector size in Options : DSP Settings.  Try values of 512, 1024, or 2048 until the problem goes away.

5) Sample rate should be set to 96k for best quality and bandwidth

6) The name of the file to run is:

maxsdr5c.maxpat (for full version)
maxsdr5c.mxf (for collective)
maxsdr5c (for app)

If you can't find that file name look for a newer version, for example, maxsdr5d.

Tutorial patches and documentation are in the tutorial folder. If you move them somewhere else, you'll still need to have the main folder (described above) in your max user filepath - because the main folder contains patches and externals required by the tutorials.
